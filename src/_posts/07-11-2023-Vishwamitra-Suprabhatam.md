## The first Suprabhatam

<div class="sanscript">
prabhAtAyAM tu zarvaryAM vizvAmitro mahAmuni:.
<br/>
abhyabhASata kAkutsthau zayAnau parNasaMstare..1.23.1..
</div>

In the very early morning, while it was still dark, the great Sage Vishwamitra spoke to the two descendants of Kakutstha who were sleeping on a bed of leaves.


<div class="sanscript">
kausalyA suprajA rAma pUrvA sandhyA pravartate.
<br/>
uttiSTha narazArdUla kartavyaM daivamAhnikam..1.23.2..
</div>

Kausalya is endowed with a good son! O Rama, the twilight approaches. Get up O Lion among men, your morning oblations are to be performed!

## The second Suprabhatam

<div class="sanscript">
upAsya rAtrizeSaM tu zoNAkUle maharSibhi:.
<br>
nizAyAM suprabhAtAyAM vizvAmitro'bhyabhASata..1.35.1..
</div>


Having spent the rest of the night by the banks of the Shona river alongside the sages, in the very early morning while it was still dark, Vishwamitra spoke as follows.


<div class="sanscript">
suprabhAtA nizA rAma pUrvA sandhyA pravartate.
<br>
uttiSThottiSTha bhadraM te gamanAyAbhirocaya ..1.35.2..
</div>

O Rama, the darkness has become a good morning! The twilight approaches. May you be safe! Get up and ready your mind for leaving!
